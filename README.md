Tracking our networth has never been this fun


# Motivation

There's really two fundamental ways to track your financial progress.

+ Track and stay within your budget
+ Track and stay within your networth

The first one (your budget) is valient and great for starters.
It helps to bring structure to your spending, and it's fun to
"make it to the end of the month before the end of the money".

The major problem with budgeting is that you only get an
idea of spending, and not really if you are advanving.  Let's say
you diligently follow your budget of $1900, then good for you.  

But,if you are only taking home $2000, then you are only saving $1200/year.
Not really enough to build a suitable nest egg.

Instead, if you focus on your networth (i.e. add up your bank accounts and subtract your
credit cards, mortgage, car loans), you can see if you are truly improving (or not).

Not only that, you do bunch of other neat stuff like see *how* much of your salary
you are saving, without having to track a single receipt.
