      <p>A few things to point out as you get started</p>

      <p>
         1. You are free to continue using this
         application anonymously.  We have stored a small
         unique ID in your browser so that when you return
         we will remember who you are; but that very few
         (possibly just the NSA) could guess.
      </p>

      <p>
         2. If you want to use this on other devices, or browsers,
         then bookmark this long, unguessable URL: <a class="inline-link" href="https://wuw.me/a/asfdQWEasd1324asdf">https://wuw.me/a/asfdQWEasd1324asdf</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        3. If you like what you see, then you <a class="inline-link" href="#">claim your account</a> and then you can get a bunch of additional features (like notifications, account privacy, etc).
